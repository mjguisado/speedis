    # The log global directive basically says, use 
    # the log line that was set in the global section. 
    # Putting a log global directive into the defaults 
    # section is equivalent to putting it into all of 
    # the subsequent proxy sections. 
    # So, this will enable logging on all proxies.

    # By default, output from HAProxy is minimal.
    # Adding the line option httplog to your defaults 
    # section will enable more verbose HTTP logging, 
    # which we will explain in more detail later.
